-- looking for PCL_PEOPLE
CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/248/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PCL_PEOPLE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (PCL).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:616 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)
